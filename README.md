Banking Application Deployment with Docker Image on AWS
Authored by Joseph White
# <ins>Purpose</ins>

Our Banking Application is meticulously designed using advanced technologies such as Docker, Terraform, and Jenkins. This initiative is driven by the objective to establish a highly secure and efficient platform for managing substantial financial transactions. Docker facilitates a uniform and dependable setup, while Terraform proficiently orchestrates the infrastructure. The 
incorporation of Jenkins is critical for ensuring smooth and continuous updates, paramount in the banking sector's dynamic landscape.

# <ins> Steps </ins>

<ins>1) Git Clone Repository</ins>

The integration of [Git](https://github.com/z0sun/runit/blob/main/gitclone.md) in the deployment process of our Banking Application is a deliberate and strategic decision. It serves as the backbone for a coherent and collaborative development workflow, ensuring that every code modification is rigorously tracked and scrutinized. This step is essential to uphold the security and reliability standards requisite in a banking platform.

<ins>2) Terraform Files</ins>

Implementing the Jenkins environment through our [.tf](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/intTerraform/jenkinsdocterra.tf) file is a pivotal step in the deployment of our Banking App. This step harmoniously integrates Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform, optimizing our workflow. Jenkins excels in automating critical tasks like build and test processes, thereby elevating operational efficiency. Docker assures environmental consistency, and Terraform skillfully manages our cloud-based infrastructure. This phase is fundamental in refining our update processes, thus maintaining the resilience and currency of our application.

<ins>3) Docker File</ins>

Central to our project, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/dockerfile) acts as the blueprint for constructing the Docker image of our Banking Application, optimized for compatibility with an RDS database. This file is instrumental in ensuring a standard and replicable build process, encompassing all necessary steps, from setting up the application environment to installing dependencies, thereby guaranteeing a consistent and reliable deployment process.

<ins>4) Jenkins Setup/Pipeline</ins>

- The establishment of a Jenkins manager and the allocation of tasks to two distinct Jenkins nodes, one for [Docker](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/Docker%20Agent.png) and the other for [Terraform](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/Terraform%20Agent.png), permits an efficient workload distribution: the Docker node is dedicated to containerization tasks, assuring consistent packaging and deployment of our application, while the Terraform node adeptly administers infrastructure aspects. This fortifies our CI/CD pipeline, substantially enhancing the caliber of our integration and deployment processes, and ensuring that our Banking Application is agile, robust, and scalable.

- The first four steps (Test, Build, Login, Push) of the [Jenkins pipeline](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/Build%20Stages.png) are handled by the `docker node` while the remaining three (Init, Plan, Apply) are handled by the `terraform agent`.

<ins>Database</ins> 

- The [RDS (Relational Database Service)](https://github.com/z0sun/Deployment7/blob/main/database.py) database plays a critical role in managing and storing the data for the Banking Application. RDS, being a managed database service provided by AWS, offers a reliable, scalable, and efficient solution for handling the application's database needs. It is responsible for securely storing all transactional data, user information, and other relevant records, ensuring data integrity and high availability. The use of RDS allows the Banking Application to benefit from automated backups, easy scalability, and robust security features, all of which are essential for a financial application handling sensitive data. This integration not only streamlines the database management aspect but also significantly reduces the operational burden and complexity associated with traditional database administration.

# <ins>Issues and Troubleshooting Insights</ins>
- Enhanced Issue Localization Through Pipeline Segmentation: The structured division of tasks in the Jenkins pipeline significantly aided in isolating and identifying specific problems. This granular approach was particularly effective in troubleshooting.

- Common Challenges: Naming Conventions and Resource Allocation: Most issues I faced stemmed from naming conventions in Terraform configurations and resource allocation strategies. For instance, I frequently encountered the maximum VPC limit, a situation that arose due to the persistent existence of Terraform-instantiated infrastructure, which was not being appropriately destroyed after each build cycle.

# <ins>Optimization/Conclusion</ins> 

- Leverage Autoscaling and Load Balancing: Implement autoscaling for your ECS services to ensure that the application can handle varying loads efficiently. Combined with the Application Load Balancer (ALB), this will enhance the application's availability and responsiveness, automatically adjusting to traffic demands while balancing the load across multiple instances.

- Optimize Docker Images and Container Management: Focus on building lean and efficient Docker images by minimizing layers and removing unnecessary dependencies. This will reduce the image size and startup time, leading to faster deployments and scaling. Additionally, manage containers effectively by monitoring their performance and health, and use Docker's best practices to manage container lifecycle.

 - Enhance Monitoring and Logging: Utilize AWS CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring and logging of both the application and infrastructure. Setting up detailed metrics and alerts for performance, errors, and resource usage will enable proactive issue identification and resolution, improving the overall stability and efficiency of the deployment.

# <ins>Deployment Conclusion</ins>
The successful completion of this deployment marks a significant milestone in our journey towards a robust, cloud-native architecture for the Banking Application. Throughout this process, we have effectively leveraged a suite of powerful technologies including Docker, AWS ECS, RDS, Jenkins, and Terraform, culminating in a scalable, resilient, and efficient system. Key learnings from challenges faced, particularly in aspects of resource management and pipeline optimization, have provided invaluable insights that will guide future enhancements. This deployment not only achieves its immediate operational goals but also lays a solid foundation for continuous integration, development, and scaling, aligning with our commitment to delivering a high-quality, reliable banking service. The collaborative effort and the iterative approach adopted in this project underscore our ability to adapt and evolve in a dynamic technological landscape.
